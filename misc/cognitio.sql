Kondisi itu memungkinkan industri perbankan menurunkan tingkat bunga kredit ( lending rate ). \"Kunci penurunan lending rate , pemerintah harus menyerap anggaran, agar market melihat bahwa pemerintah serius membangun (infrastruktur),\" kata Economist DBS Group Research, Gundy Cahyadi, ketika ditemui dalam acara Peluang dan Tantangan Pasar Indonesia di 2015 , di Hotel Dharmawangsa, Jakarta, Rabu (25/2/2015). Menurut Gundy, penurunan BI Rate ke posisi 7,5 persen tidak berdampak besar bagi perbankan untuk menurunkan bunga kredit. Hal itu dikarenakan perbankan melihat tingkat bunga pinjaman sebesar 12 persen masih kompetitif. Dia berharap, penurunan BI Rate ini membuat pemerintah tidak lagi menekan Bank Indonesia (BI) untuk menurunkan BI rate yang saat ini berada di posisi 7,5 persen. Gundy menjelaskan, dalam menurunkan suku bunga kredit perbankan tidak melulu melalui BI rate, di mana seharusnya pemerintah bisa berkoordinasi dengan Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) dalam menurunkan suku bunga kredit dan pinjaman. Khususnya di sektor infrastruktur dan properti yang mendukung program pembangunan pemerintah. \" Lending rate untuk infrastruktur dan properti itu tergantung dari pendapatan bunga dan permintaan kredit,\" tegas dia. Walaupun BI sangat sulit menurunkan suku bunga perbankan, lanjut dia, BI memiliki ruang dalam memacu industri perbankan melipatgandakan kredit produktifnya dengan menurunkan bunga Depocit Facility.

Shome, who was Rabobankâ€™s India chief executive officer and country head, will join DBS as CEO of its Indian business effective 15 April, the Singapore-based lender said in an emailed statement on Friday. Bhasin, 60, has decided to leave DBS after almost seven years as head of its operations in the country, according to the statement, which said he â€œwould like to pursue different interests.â€ South-east Asiaâ€™s largest lender earlier this month posted its lowest quarterly profit in more than two years after trading income slumped and allowances for bad loans surged in south Asia. Net income at DBSâ€™s Indian business slumped more than 99% in the year through March 2014, the sharpest drop among the five largest foreign banks by branches in India. Bhasin, who started his career with HSBCâ€™s India operations in 1979, had been with DBS since September 2008, according to the Singapore-based lenderâ€™s website. His last day at the bank will be 30 June, according to the statement. DBS Indiaâ€™s gross bad loan ratio more than doubled to 13.6% by the end of September, from 5.8% a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the highest level among the 55 largest banks by assets in the nation and compares to the average 4.5% ratio for the entire Indian banking system, the data shows. Shome resigned last week from Rabobankâ€™s Indian unit, which he joined in July 2009, Nayna Banerjee, a spokeswoman for the lender, said on 26 February. He previously worked at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and at Citigroup Inc., where his tenure overlapped with DBS chief executive officer Piyush Gupta. DBS, which has opened 12 Indian branches since 1995, said in July itâ€™s exploring the formation of a local subsidiary after the central bank eased procedures for foreign lenders. Such a move would allow the Singapore bank to open branches anywhere in India under the same rules as local banks. Bloomberg'),

However, this included a Rmb315m additional provision for Held-to-Maturity (HTM) investments in 4Q14, as management prudently raised the impairment from 5% to 15% for HTM investments exposed to the property sector (c.32% of total portfolio) . The writedown of raw material inventories was net off by recognition of forfeited deposits for cancelled vessels two years back. Stripping the provision out, FY14 PATMI would have been Rmb3.79bn, 6%/13% above our/consensusâ€™ estimates. Yangzijiang declared 5.5 Scts final DPS (higher than last yearâ€™s 5 Scts), implying 4.4% yield . Healthy margins â–  Shipbuilding gross margin moderated 3.5ppts q-o-q to 17.5% in 4Q, due largely to maiden recognition of a jack up project (60% in 4Q14) at cost in that quarter. Full year shipbuilding gross margin was around 20%. Strong balance sheet â–  Including HTM investments, Yangzjiang is in net cash, equivalent to 29 Scts per share or 23% of its NTA . Outlook Set to outperform peers â–  Yangzijiang is set to outperform peers with 5- to 10-ppt higher margins (through better newbuild prices, payment terms and efficiency as well as active cash management) and relatively stable profits with upside potential from the recognition of relocation fees from the government (Rmb720m) and profits from disposal of previously cancelled vessels of c.Rmb600m. Divestment of non-core assets â–  Yangzijiang is paring down its non-core investments as promised. HTM investments have reduced to Rmb10.8bn, from Rmb13.0bn in mid-2014. This is expected to be further scaled back to less than Rmb10bn by end-2015. It has also divested c.Rmb1.8bn worth of property projects since 2Q14 and targets to divest the remaining Rmb1.5bn (excluding old yard redevelopment of approx. Rmb1.4bn) in the near future. Climbing up the value chain â–  Yangzijiang has secured US$135m worth of orders to build two 27.5k cbm LNG carriers in mid-Feb, marking its first foray into this sophisticated vessel market, long dominated by Korean peers . The group recorded decent order wins of US$1.8bn in 2014, bringing orderbook to US$4.62bn as of end 2014. This translates into a healthy book-to-bill of 1.9x. Management aims to secure US$2bn worth of orders this year . Technical Analysis Daily Chart Valuation We value Yangzijiang based on sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) methodology, to better reflect the valuation for its various segments . We arrive at a target price of S$1.62 , after applying 8x FY15F price earnings (PE) on shipbuilding earnings, 0.5x price-to-book value (P/BV) for bulk carriers, 1x P/BV for investments, and 25% discount to net present value (NPV) of its property project. Risks Prolonged industry downturn â–  While we believe the worst is over for the shipbuilding industry, in the event of unforeseen circumstances that lead to a prolonged downturn, Yangzijiangâ€™s earnings and share price will be adversely affected. Spike in steel price â–  Steel cost accounts for 20-25% of COGS . We estimate that every 1% increase in steel cost could reduce net profit by 1.1%. ( Read Report ) Source : DBS Group Research'),

Check out our in-depth coverage MUMBAI: Whenever an enterprise is in trouble, it is not unusual for vultures to circle it. Will it be different for Standard Chartered where shareholders have prevailed in overthrowing the management? What is in store for the Asia-focused lender? That the first step in shaking up the management has been done, the choice of replacement for chief executive Peter Sands , Bill Winters, formerly of JPMorgan Chase , has led to speculation as to the direction he could choose to steer the bank. The options are that either Winters goes through the painful process of weeding out the bad bank, and rebuild it for it to stand on its own legs over many years. Or indulge in cosmetic changes for a few quarters with drastic cost cuts and sell it off to a CEO who is desperate to get bigger in Asia irrespective of the dented business. Winters made his name in the investment banking business of JPMorgan before breaking with Jamie Dimon. To rebuild the business, he has to focus on Indian operations which was once its best, but has fallen on bad times. The 2005 acquisition of Korea First Bank for $3.3 billion has also become sour and needs to be sold off, say analysts. \"There is nothing as a good or a bad deal,\" said the head of an international bank who did not want to be identified. \"Standard Chartered Bank\'s balance sheet is stressed. At the right price, global banks wanting to increase their presence in Asia could consider the option.\" But the question is which global bank will tread into Asia - a bit part of it is India and China - when many have already burnt their fingers and retreated. The US banks wouldn\'t want to get into Asian retail business, and so is the case with European giants such as Credit Agricole , Deutsche Bank or others, said analysts. \"We decline to comment on speculation,\" said a Standard Chartered spokesperson. \"In terms of strategy, we will be updating the market next week as part of our results.\" Even if Western banks are not interested, The Australia New Zealand Banking Group or others from the region which are expanding in Asia could be interested. But even they are focusing more on corporate business, rather than chasing the consumer wallet. The fact that Temasek Holdings , the government of Singapore\'s investment company, is the single-largest shareholder in Standard Chartered as well as DBS Group Holdings has prompted some to expect that the investor could work out a strategy to combine the two. \"A transaction of this nature would be very complicated and distract us from our current growth strategy. Hence, it is not on our agenda at this time,\" DBS said, in an email response. Whether Winters decides to trim Standard Chartered to make it a profitable bank, or sells it to a desperate CEO to get bigger, Temasek will have the final say.

Check out our in-depth coverage DBS India head Sanjiv Bhasin has resigned for personal reasons and will be replaced by Surojit Shome, who quit as chief executive of Rabobank earlier this month. Bhasin, who turned 60 this month, plans to pursue different interests, Singapore headquartered DBS Bank said in a statement on Friday. His seven-year stint will end on June 30, it added. \"Shome, CEO and country head of Rabobank India, will assume the role of CEO of DBS India with effect from April 15,\" the bank said. DBS Group Holdings, Southeast Asia\'s largest lender, posted its lowest quarterly profit at the end of December 2014 in more than two years, as trading income slumped and provisions for bad loans increased. The bank, which has 12 branches in the country, has seen a 46% dip in profits to Rs 299.2 crore at the end of March 2014 compared with Rs 554.5 crore last year. The bank\'s stressed assets in the small and medium enterprises business has led to a steep rise in its bad loans. Non-performing loans of the bank more than doubled to 10.19% at the end of March 2014 compared with 2.37% last year. Shome, who has worked with Lehman Brothers and Citigroup, faces the challenge of cleaning up DBS\' India book and bring growth back to the balance sheet. Globally, investors and shareholders are increasingly becoming intolerant towards bank managements and boards, with depressed profitability following slowdown in growth markets like India. On Thursday, London-headquartered Asia centric Standard Chartered saw a management reshuffle with the exit of Peter Sands, its chief executive officer, and Asia head Jaspal Bindra. Bill Winters, a former JPMorgan Chase investment banker, was appointed the new chief executive of the UK bank. DON\'T MISS any stories, follow us on Twitter Follow');
